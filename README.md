BudgetWisely is an application designed to organize finances in an easy, structured, and effective way. The main motivation behind this project was to address the challenges that complicate the process of financial managementâ€”challenges such as a lack of clear insight into personal income and expenses, unplanned expenditures, and insufficient awareness about saving.

That's why BudgetWisely aims to solve these problems, enabling users to make better and easier financial decisions, manage their capital effectively, and ultimately achieve their financial goals.
